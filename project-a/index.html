                This is an energy life form, it grows, dies, reproduces in the orders of the observers. In a conventional environment without orders, it floats and breathes. Its descendants sometimes differ from others in appearance and “personalities”.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Mouse-based and “space” keyboard interactions. While the creature and its descendants hold differences in their “personalities”, the creatures will show different responses to the observers’ interactions. Try to move your mouse to find their characteristics.
